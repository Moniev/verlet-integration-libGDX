# Verlet Algorithm with Multithreading and Octree  

This project implements the **Verlet integration algorithm** for simulating particle motion in a 3D space. To optimize performance, it utilizes **multithreading** and an **Octree** for efficient spatial partitioning and collision detection.  

## Features  
- **Multithreading**: Parallel computation for improved performance.  
- **Octree-based spatial partitioning**: Reduces complexity of neighbor searches.  
- **Stable and accurate Verlet integration**: Ensures smooth motion without numerical instability.  

## Installation  
1. **Coming soon**
