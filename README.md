# Verlet Algorithm with Multithreading and Octree  

This project models the motion of particles in a three-dimensional space with the aid of Verlet integration, which is a numerical method that predicts the object's location over time without keeping track of its velocity; rather, it predicts the next position using the existing and previous positions along with some external force like, for instance, gravity. This technique is more energy efficient and numerically stable than simple Euler integration, hence more applicable for physics simulations.

## Features  
- **Multithreading**: Parallel computation for improved performance.  
- **Octree-based spatial partitioning**: Reduces complexity of neighbor searches.  
- **Stable and accurate Verlet integration**: Ensures smooth motion without numerical instability.
- **Resolving smoothly over 8k objects.**

## Installation  
- **Coming soon**
